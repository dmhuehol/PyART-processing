    DESCRIPTION: Calculates the Rasmussen snow rate from a given reflectivity field,
    then adds said field to the radar object.
    
    NOTE THAT THE NEW SNOW RATE FIELD IS NOT FORMATTED EXACTLY THE SAME AS A NORMAL PYART DATA FIELD
    PyART data fields are by default masked arrays with a data, mask, and fill_value component. The new 
    snow rate field will simply be an array.
